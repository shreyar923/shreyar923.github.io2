# Shreya Ramesh's Portfolio

Hi! I am a first year CSUF student majoring in Biological Sciences. I am retaking this class 
as I was a Computer Science major in the previous semester. My expected graduation date is after Spring 2027. 

# My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7, part 2: 
Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I think that the logistics with the road signs
was interesting. I thought the parking signs was a little difficult to figure out, but still fun. 
I learned in depth how to work with different functions and overall enjoyed the parking signs
scheme.

Lab 9, Part 1: 
This lab was intriguing to me because spell checkers are really helpful tools and making one
really helped me see what was behind the ones I've seen online. It helped me understand how to use
for loops in a more complex way, too. Basically, I think it was a hard but cool lab. 

Lab 8, Part 1: 
This lab was at first really intimidating to me because of the math involved. When I was going
through it, I remember I was confused, but even still, it was enjoyable for me to do because
it got me thinking. I think the concept was different with it being about Olympic judges and 
I learned more about using arguments in this one, too.
